abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.The usability of requirements engineering (RE) techniques has been recognised as a key factor for their successful adoption by industry. RE techniques must be accessible to stakeholders with different backgrounds, so they can be empowered to effectively and efficiently contribute to building successful systems. When selecting an appropriate requirements engineering technique for a given context, one should consider the usability supported by each of the candidate techniques. The first step towards achieving this goal is to gather the best evidence available on the usability of RE approaches by performing a systematic literature review, to answer one research question: How is the usability of requirements engineering techniques and tools addressed? We systematically review articles published in the Requirements Engineering Journal, one of the main sources for mature work in RE, to motivate a research roadmap to make RE approaches more accessible to stakeholders with different backgrounds.},

A set of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} slant column densities at different elevation angles can be obtained with the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique used in the multiple axis configuration. Measurements have been carried out in the Presidential Estate at Castel Porziano (Rome) using this technique, in the frame of a programme started in 1994 for studying and monitoring the Estate's environment, in the period from September to November 2006. The retrieval of information on the vertical profile of a trace gas obtained from slant column density DOAS measurements requires: (1) the simulation of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere for Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation concerning the target trace gases; (2) the application of inversion schemes to derive the vertical profile of the gas pollutants under interest using the AMF matrix as the kernel of the inversion algorithm. In this paper the first retrieved vertical profiles of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and their time evolution during the day are presented and discussed.},

Our instrument was 146 m, 196 m, and 280 m apart from three different build-ings located along a main Avenue. We obtain temporal vari-ation of NO 2 mixing ratios between 30 ppb and 65 ppb from measurements of November 2007 and mixing ratios up to 50 ppb from measurements of August and September 2008. Our measurements demonstrate that ToTaL-DOAS observa-tions can be made over relative short distances.

abstract = {Numerical studies were performed to evaluate a new air monitoring method for reconstructing chemical exposures and source emissions, based upon optical remote sensing (ORS) and computed tomography (CT). With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized.},

abstract = {Background: Air pollution is becoming an increased burden to the world. Previous studies have confirmed its effects on adverse birth outcomes, but few associated with premature small for gestational age (SGA). We report a retrospective cohort study conducted in Changzhou city to evaluate the association between air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2 and NO2) and premature SGA during pregnancy. Methods: A total of 46,224 births were collected from January, 2013 to December, 2016, in Changzhou Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, finally 2709 preterm births were admitted for study. Corresponding air monitoring data were collected from Changzhou Environmental Protection Agency. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between these air pollutants and premature SGA controlling for individual covariates in single- and multi-pollutant models. Results: We found that, in the third trimester, every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increments in PM2.5 concentration were associated with premature SGA (OR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-2.83; OR = 1.37, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-3.58) in two- and three-pollutants models. In the whole gestation, a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration in two- and three-pollutant models were related to premature SGA (OR = 1.53, 95{\%} CI: 1.38-2.47; OR = 1.73, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-2.57). The OR (95{\%} CI) of premature SGA were increasing across quintiles of PM2.5, SO2, NO2 concentrations during the whole gestation period adjusting for confounders (P for trend {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: These results indicated that pregnant women exposed to PM2.5, combined with other pollutants in the third trimester have a higher risk to deliver premature SGA babies, providing further evidence linking PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes.},

abstract = {The London smog of 1952 is one of history's most important air pollution episodes in terms of its impact on science, public perception of air pollution, and government regulation. The association between health and air pollution during the episode was evident as a strong rise in air pollution levels was immediately followed by sharp increases in mortality and morbidity. However, mortality in the months after the smog was also elevated above normal levels. An initial government report proposed the hypothesis that influenza was responsible for high mortality during these months. Estimates of the number of influenza deaths were generated using multiple methods, indicating that only a fraction of the deaths in the months after the smog could be attributable to influenza. Sensitivity analysis reveals that only an extremely severe influenza epidemic could account for the majority of the excess deaths for this time period. Such an epidemic would be on the order of twice the case-fatality rate and quadruple the incidence observed in a general medical practice during the winter of 1953. These results underscore the need for diligence regarding extremely high air pollution that still exists in many parts of the world.},

abstract = {Volcanic eruptions emit plumes of ash and gases into the atmosphere, potentially at very high altitudes. Ash-rich plumes are hazardous for airplanes as ash is very abrasive and easily melts inside their engines. With more than 50 active volcanoes per year and the ever-increasing number of commercial flights, the safety of airplanes is a real concern. Satellite measurements are ideal for monitoring global volcanic activity and, in combination with atmospheric dispersion models, to track and forecast volcanic plumes. Here we present the Support to Aviation Control Service (SACS, http://sacs.aeronomie.be/ecosystem), which is a free online service initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA) for the near-real-time (NRT) satellite monitoring of volcanic plumes of SO2 and ash. It combines data from three ultraviolet (UV)-visible and three infrared (IR) spectrometers. The UV-vis sensors are the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) on-board the two polar orbiting meteorological satellites (MetOp-A {\&} MetOp-B) operated by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The IR sensors are the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on-board MetOp-A {\&} MetOp-B. This new multi-sensor warning system of volcanic emissions is based on the selective detection of SO2 and ash. This system is optimised to avoid false alerts while at the same time limiting the number of notifications in case of large plumes. A successful rate with more than 95{\%} of notifications corresponding to true volcanic activity is obtained by the SACS system.},

abstract = {We apply a novel experimental procedure for the rapid measurement of the average volume mixing ratios (VMRs) and horizontal distributions of trace gases such as NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the boundary layer, which was recently suggested by Sinreich et al. (2013). The method is based on two-dimensional scanning multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS). It makes use of two facts (Sinreich et al., 2013): first, the light path for observations at 1° elevation angle traverses mainly air masses located close to the ground (typically 4. Thus, the average value of the trace gas VMR in the atmospheric layer between the surface and the particular altitude, for which this observation was sensitive, can be calculated. Compared to the originally proposed method, we introduce several important modifications and improvements: We apply the method only to measurements at 1° elevation angle (besides zenith view), for which the uncertainties of the retrieved values of the VMRs and surface extinctions are especially small. Using only 1° elevation angle for off-axis observation also allows an increased temporal resolution. We determine (and apply) correction factors (and their uncertainties) directly as function of the measured O4 absorption. Finally, the method is extended to trace gases analysed at other wavelengths and also to the retrieval of aerosol extinction. Depending on atmospheric visibility, the typical uncertainty of the results ranges from about 20{\%} to 30{\%}. We apply the rapid method to observations of a newly-developed ground-based multifunctional passive differential optical absorption spectroscopy (GM-DOAS) instrument in the north-west outskirts near Hefei in China. We report NO2, SO2, and HCHO VMRs and aerosol extinction for four azimuth angles and compare these results with those from simultaneous long-path DOAS observations. Good agreement is found (squares of the correlation coefficients for NO2, SO2, and HCHO were 0.92, 0.85, and 0.60, respectively), verifying the reliability of this novel method. Similar agreement is found for the comparison of the aerosol extinction with results from visibility meters. Future studies may conduct measurements using a larger number of azimuth angles to increase the spatial resolution.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An emerging body of evidence has raised concern regarding the potentially harmful effects of inhaled pollutants on the central nervous system during the last decade. In the general population, traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure has been associated with adverse effects on cognitive, behavior, and psychomotor development in children, and with cognitive decline and higher risk of dementia in the elderly. Recently, studies have interfaced environmental epidemiology with magnetic resonance imaging to investigate in vivo the effects of TRAP on the human brain. The aim of this systematic review was to describe and synthesize the findings from these studies. The bibliographic search was carried out in PubMed with ad hoc keywords. RECENT FINDINGS: The selected studies revealed that cerebral white matter, cortical gray matter, and basal ganglia might be the targets of TRAP. The detected brain damages could be involved in cognition changes. The effect of TRAP on cognition appears to be biologically plausible. Interfacing environmental epidemiology and neuroimaging is an emerging field with room for improvement. Future studies, together with inputs from experimental findings, should provide more relevant and detailed knowledge about the nature of the relationship between TRAP exposure and cognitive, behavior, and psychomotor disorders observed in the general population.},

abstract = {New burned area datasets and top-down constraints from atmospheric concentration measurements of pyrogenic gases have decreased the large uncertainty in fire emissions estimates. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, savanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 19972009 period on a 0.5 spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards, estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections, and plant productivity from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the MODIS era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) active fire data prior to MODIS (19972000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) were 2.0 Pg C year1 with significant interannual variability during 19972001 (2.8 Pg C year1 in 1998 and 1.6 Pg C year1 in 2001). Globally, emissions during 20022007 were relatively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 20022007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South America, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the MODIS era (20012009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and savannas (44{\%}) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20{\%}), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16{\%}), forest fires (mostly in the extratropics, 15{\%}), agricultural waste burning (3{\%}), and tropical peat fires (3{\%}). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13{\%} lower than in our previous (GFED2) work. For reduced trace gases such as CO and CH4, deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

This gives rise to the urgent need to detect forest fires as fast as possible. This paper highlights the powerful feature of wireless sensor networks as a potential solution to the challenge of early detection of forest fires. The device presented makes use of various sensors attached and wireless data transmission, to fulfill the task in question. These collected data are transmitted to the small satellite and the satellite transmits the data to the ground station where they are analyzed. The proposed scheme based on wireless sensor networks performs early detection of any fire threat.},

abstract = {There is a growing body of research on the association between ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes. However, people in high income countries spend most of their time indoors. Pregnant women spend much of that time at home. The aim of this study was to investigate if indoor air pollutants were associated with poor birth outcomes. Pregnant women were recruited prior to 18 weeks gestation. They completed a housing questionnaire and household chemical use survey. Indoor pollutants, formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were monitored in the women's homes at 34 weeks gestation. Gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW) and length (BL) and head circumference (HC) were collected from birth records. The associations between measured pollutants, and pollution surrogates, were analysed using general linear models, controlling for maternal age, parity, maternal health, and season of birth. Only HCHO was associated with any of the birth outcomes. There was a 0.044 decrease in BW z-score (p = 0.033) and 0.05 decrease in HC z-score (p = 0.06) for each unit increase in HCHO. Although HCHO concentrations were very low, this finding is consistent with other studies of formaldehyde and poor birth outcomes.},

@article{Wagner2007,
abstract = {The results of a comparison exercise of radiative transfer models (RTM) of various international research groups for Multiple AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) viewing geometry are presented. Besides the assessment of the agreement between the different models, a second focus of the comparison was the systematic investigation of the sensitivity of the MAX-DOAS technique under various viewing geometries and aerosol conditions. In contrast to previous comparison exercises, box-air-mass-factors (box-AMFs) for different atmospheric height layers were modelled, which describe the sensitivity of the measurements as a function of altitude. In addition, radiances were calculated allowing the identification of potential errors, which might be overlooked if only AMFs are compared. Accurate modelling of radiances is also a prerequisite for the correct interpretation of satellite observations, for which the received radiance can strongly vary across the large ground pixels, and might be also important for the retrieval of aerosol properties as a future application of MAX-DOAS. The comparison exercises included different wavelengths and atmospheric scenarios ( with and without aerosols). The strong and systematic influence of aerosol scattering indicates that from MAX-DOAS observations also information on atmospheric aerosols can be retrieved. During the various iterations of the exercises, the results from all models showed a substantial convergence, and the final data sets agreed for most cases within about 5{\%}. Larger deviations were found for cases with low atmospheric optical depth, for which the photon path lengths along the line of sight of the instrument can become very large. The differences occurred between models including full spherical geometry and those using only plane parallel approximation indicating that the correct treatment of the Earth's sphericity becomes indispensable. The modelled box-AMFs constitute an universal data base for the calculation of arbitrary ( total) AMFs by simple convolution with a given trace gas concentration profile. Together with the modelled radiances and the specified settings for the various exercises, they can serve as test cases for future RTM developments.},

abstract = {Imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IDOAS) is an optical remote-sensing method using scattered sunlight as light source. It combines a "pushbroom" imaging spectrometer with the DOAS technique and thus allows imaging two-dimensional trace gas distributions, e.g., in volcanic plumes. The highly sensitive and specific detection of many trace gases simultaneously (specific molecules, not just elements, e.g. SO2, BrO, NO2, O3, HCHO, etc.) is possible, and the temporal and spatial variation of these gases can be measured. The IDOAS system presented here enables the taking of two-dimensional images of trace gas distributions in a volcanic plume with a spatial resolution of 100 pixels horizontally × 64 pixels vertically, each with a field of view of 0.087° in horizontal and 0.208° in vertical directions. Therefore, IDOAS provides useful information about the chemical composition and chemical variability in a volcanic plume and allows studying plume dispersal and chemical transformations. The technique was applied to map the SO2 distribution in the plume of Mt. Etna volcano for the first time in October 2003. {\textcopyright} 2005 N. Bobrowski. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Forest fires are an important component of the savanna, tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. The increasing rate of the occurrence of fires however has increased the concern over their impacts on climate change and fragile ecosystems. This requires efficient and effective methods in forest fire detection for near real-time monitoring so as to minimize these impacts. Remote sensing has been widely used in active forest fire detection; however there are some limitations in contextual algorithms which are used in forest fire detection. These contextual algorithms are greatly affected by clouds and different land cover types such as land and water with inherent temperatures included in the N x N matrix and this brings errors. As a step towards minimizing these problems an automated multi-temporal threshold algorithm was developed in this study using MSG satellite and ground fire data from Portugal. The algorithm is based on temperature anomalies detected in IR3.9 channel and the difference between IR3.9 and IR10.8 channels as well as the solar zenith angles for day, night and twilight conditions. Thresholds were set to determine actual fires and possible fires depending on how far the temperature of a particular point or pixel deviates from the normal background temperature which is estimated using the images directly prior to the actual image. The accuracy of the algorithm was compared with that of the MSG FIR-G product. The McNemar's test was used for significance test of the difference between the multi-temporal threshold algorithm and the MSG FIR-G product which uses a contextual algorithm. This study shows that the multi-temporal threshold algorithm has higher fire detection rate (50{\%}) as compared to MSG FIR-G (3.7{\%}) when ground data from Portugal was used for validation. There is a significant difference between these methods (McNemar's test ( x2) = 5.45, df = 1, p-value = 0.0196). The superiority of the multitemporal threshold algorithm over the contextual algorithm and significant difference between these methods was also confirmed in Southern Africa when MODIS fire product was used for validation. The automated procedure takes less than 15 minutes to produce the fire map, so it can cope with MSG satellite 15 minutes temporal resolution. Therefore the multi-temporal threshold algorithm performs better than the contextual algorithms in forest fire detection however there are some outstanding problems such as the transparent clouds that are not easily detected which may increase the errors in fire detection. Although this method was developed based on Portugal data it has been shown that it can be applied to other areas in the view of MSG satellite. This method can be easily adapted to other geostationary satellites and only the solar zenith angles have to be specific to the particular satellite.},

abstract = {Context: In recent years, many usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been employed to evaluate Web applications. However, many of these applications still do not meet most customers' usability expectations and many companies have folded as a result of not considering Web usability issues. No studies currently exist with regard to either the use of usability evaluation methods for the Web or the benefits they bring. Objective: The objective of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge that is available as regards the usability evaluation methods (UEMs) that have been employed to evaluate Web applications over the last 14 years. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to assess the UEMs that have been used by researchers to evaluate Web applications and their relation to the Web development process. Systematic mapping studies are useful for categorizing and summarizing the existing information concerning a research question in an unbiased manner. Results: The results show that around 39{\%} of the papers reviewed reported the use of evaluation methods that had been specifically crafted for the Web. The results also show that the type of method most widely used was that of User Testing. The results identify several research gaps, such as the fact that around 90{\%} of the studies applied evaluations during the implementation phase of the Web application development, which is the most costly phase in which to perform changes. A list of the UEMs that were found is also provided in order to guide novice usability practitioners. Conclusions: From an initial set of 2703 papers, a total of 206 research papers were selected for the mapping study. The results obtained allowed us to reach conclusions concerning the state-of-the-art of UEMs for evaluating Web applications. This allowed us to identify several research gaps, which subsequently provided us with a framework in which new research activities can be more appropriately positioned, and from which useful information for novice usability practitioners can be extracted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It combines Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy yielding average concentrations of trace gases along long light paths with reconstruction methods from computerised tomography. Here we refer to reconstructions from ground based measurements using artificial light sources. We present our reconstruction method, consisting in a discrete approach, and show that for locally confined distributions like dispersions plumes, reconstruction quality and reconstructed total concentrations can be tremendously improved by choosing an optimal parametrisation in terms of basis functions and dimension of the discretisation grid. Choice of the light path geometry has large influence as well, where for constant number of light paths, increasing the number of emitting systems tends to improve reconstructions. The method is applied to data from an indoor measurement and results are in good agreement with expectations, while the impact of measurement errors is moderate. This method will be applied to an experiment intended to measure cross sections of trace gas distributions over the city centre of Heidelberg, Germany, taking place in spring and summer 2005.},

abstract = {Research in the last several years has indicated that fire size and frequency are on the rise in western U.S. forests. Although fire size and frequency are important, they do not necessarily scale with ecosystem effects of fire, as different ecosystems have different ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Our study assessed trends and patterns in fire size and frequency from 1910 to 2008 (all fires {\textgreater} 40 ha), and the percentage of high-severity in fires from 1987 to 2008 (all fires {\textgreater} 400 ha) on the four national forests of northwestern California. During 1910-2008, mean and maximum fire size and total annual area burned increased, but we found no temporal trend in the percentage of high-severity fire during 1987-2008. The time series of severity data was strongly influenced by four years with region-wide lightning events that burned huge areas at primarily low-moderate severity. Regional fire rotation reached a high of 974 years in 1984 and fell to 95 years by 2008. The percentage of high-severity fire in conifer-dominated forests was generally higher in areas dominated by smaller-diameter trees than in areas with larger-diameter trees. For Douglas-fir forests, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ significantly between areas that re-burned and areas that only burned once (10{\%} vs. 9{\%}) when re-burned within 30 years. Percentage of high-severity fire decreased to 5{\%} when intervals between first and second fires were {\textgreater} 30 years. In contrast, in both mixed-conifer and fir/high-elevation conifer forests, the percentage of high-severity fire was less when re-burned within 30 years compared to first-time burned (12{\%} vs. 16{\%} for mixed conifer; 11{\%} vs. 19{\%} for fir/high-elevation conifer). Additionally, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ whether the re-burn interval was less than or greater than 30 years. Years with larger fires and greatest area burned were produced by region-wide lightning events, and characterized by less winter and spring precipitation than years dominated by smaller human-ignited fires. Overall percentage of high-severity fire was generally less in years characterized by these region-wide lightning events. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, wildfires could be more extensively used to achieve ecological and management objectives in northwestern California.},

Though there are several existing techniques, it seems helpful to have a more automated method to remove the possible errors that hinder clearer image reconstruction. Here, we proposed an alternative method and new algorithm using the sinogram and the fixed point. A new physical concept of Center of Attenuation (CA) was also introduced to figure out how this fixed point is applied to the image reconstruction with errors we further categorized. Our technique showed a promising performance in restoring images with translation and vertical tilt errors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP). METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated. RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96{\%}) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p {\textless} 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4{\%} lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p {\textless} 0.05) and 30.8{\%} lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p {\textless} 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p {\textless} 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP. CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction {\textgreater}50{\%} while maintaining image quality. Key Points • Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection • At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours • In body CTA a dose reduction of {\textgreater}50{\%} might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.},

abstract = {A new mathematical optimization method is presented for reconstructing pollution plume concentrations from tomographic remote sensing measurements on neighborhood scales (about 1 km ?? 1 km) using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). The new method, called CAT-4Dvar, combines Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) and 4D variational (4Dvar) data assimilation. The objective of the method is to produce accurate reconstructions compared to the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and other non-variational methods with only a small number of DOAS telescopes. A forward and adjoint 3D grid dispersion model was developed based on advection and diffusion solvers commonly used in air quality modeling. The adjoint model optimizes the model emissions and horizontal diffusion coefficient based on the difference between tomographic DOAS observations and ray path-integrated concentrations predicted by the forward model. It also updates the corresponding error covariances based on the Hessian of the cost function. An enhanced reconstruction is obtained from the forward model with optimized parameter values. In a synthetic experiment involving two hypothetical DOAS instruments, the CAT-4Dvar method yielded excellent results compared to ART, reducing the overall nearness index from 57{\%} to 11{\%}. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The approach combines path-integrated concentration data acquired with any path-integrated optical remote sensing (PI-ORS) technique and computed tomography (CT) technique. In this study, an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) instrument sampled path-integrated concentrations along five radial beam paths in a vertical plane downwind from the source. A meteorological station collected measurements of wind direction and wind speed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was released from a controlled area source simulator. The innovative CT technique, which applies the smooth basis function minimization method to the beam data in conjunction with measured wind data, was used to estimate the total flux from the simulated area source. The new approach estimates consistently underestimated the true emission rates in unstable atmospheric conditions and agreed with the true emission rate in neutral atmospheric conditions. This approach is applicable to many types of industrial areas or volume sources, given the use of an adequate PI-ORS system.},

DOAS tomography is a new technique to determine 2-and 3-dimensional concentration fields of air pollutants or other trace gases by combining dif-ferential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) with tomo-graphic inversion techniques. Due to the limited amount of measured data, the resulting concentration fields are sensitive to the inversion process. Therefore detailed error estimations are needed to determine the quality of the reconstruction. In this paper we compare different row acting methods for the inversion, present a procedure for optimizing the parameters of the reconstruction process and propose a way to estimate the error-fields by numerical studies. The procedure was ap-plied to data from the motorway emission campaign BAB II. Two dimensional NO 2 cross sections at right angles to the motorway could be reconstructed qualitatively well at differ-ent meteorological situations. Additionally we present error fields for the reconstructions which show the problems and skills of the used measurement setup. Numerical studies on an improved setup for future motorway campaigns show, that DOAS tomography is able to produce high quality concentra-tion maps.},

The method finds a spatial distribution of gas concentrations that (1) has path integrals that agree with measured path integrals, and (2) has a low third spatial derivative in each direction, at every point. The trade-off between (1) and (2) is controlled by an adjustable parameter, which can be set based on analysis of the path-integral data. The method produces a set of linear equations, which can be solved with a single matrix multiplication if the constraint that all concentrations must be positive is ignored; the method is therefore extremely rapid. Analysis of experimental data from thousands of concentration distributions shows that the method works nearly as well as smooth basis function minimization (the best method previously available), yet is about 100 times faster.

The review indicates that air pollution at current levels still poses a considerable burden on health in Europe. Many different adverse effects have been linked to exposure to air pollution, including an increased risk of cardiopulmonary disease and a reduction in life expectancy of a year or more for people living in European cities. Some of these effects occur at very low concentrations that were previously considered safe. Taken together, the evidence is sufficient to strongly recommend further policy action to reduce levels of air pollutants, including particulates, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. It is reasonable to assume that a reduction in air pollution will lead to considerable health benefits},

abstract = {Forest fire emissions have a strong impact on the concentrations of trace gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. In order to quantify the influence of boreal forest fire emissions on the atmospheric composition, the fire seasons of 1997 and 1998 are compared in this paper. Fire activity in 1998 was very strong, especially over Canada and Eastern Siberia, whereas it was much weaker in 1997. According to burned area estimates the burning in 1998 was more than six times as intense as in 1997. Based on hot spot locations derived from ATSR ( Along Track Scanning Radiometer) data and official burned area data, fire emissions were estimated and their transport was simulated with a Lagrangian tracer transport model. Siberian and Canadian forest fire tracers were distinguished to investigate the transport of both separately. The fire emissions were transported even over intercontinental distances. Due to the El Nino induced meteorological situation, transport from Siberia to Canada was enhanced in 1998. Siberian fire emissions were transported towards Canada and contributed concentrations more than twice as high as those due to Canada's own CO emissions by fires. In 1998 both tracers arrive at higher latitudes over Europe, which is due to a higher North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index in 1998. The simulated emission plumes are compared to CMDL ( Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory) CO(2) and CO data, Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS) aerosol index ( AI) data and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) tropospheric NO(2) and HCHO columns. All the data show clearly enhanced signals during the burning season of 1998 compared to 1997. The results of the model simulation are in good agreement with ground-based as well as satellite-based measurements.},

abstract = {Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spec- troscopy (MAX-DOAS) in the atmosphere is a novel mea- surement technique that represents a significant advance on the well-established zenith scattered sunlight DOAS instru- ments which are mainly sensitive to stratospheric absorbers. MAX-DOAS utilizes scattered sunlight received from mul- tiple viewing directions. The spatial distribution of various trace gases close to the instrument can be derived by combin- ing several viewing directions. Ground based MAX-DOAS is highly sensitive to absorbers in the lowest few kilome- tres of the atmosphere and vertical profile information can be retrieved by combining the measurements with Radia- tive Transfer Model (RTM) calculations. The potential of the technique for a wide variety of studies of tropospheric trace species and its (few) limitations are discussed. AMonte Carlo RTM is applied to calculate Airmass Factors (AMF) for the various viewing geometries ofMAX-DOAS. Airmass Factors can be used to quantify the light path length within the absorber layers. The airmass factor dependencies on the viewing direction and the influence of several parameters (trace gas profile, ground albedo, aerosol profile and type, solar zenith and azimuth angles) are investigated. In addition we give a brief description of the instrumental MAX-DOAS systems realised and deployed so far. The results of the RTM studies are compared to several examples of recent MAX- DOAS field experiments and an outlook for future possible applications is given.},

Air pollutant emission levels in China remain substantially higher than are those in developed countries. Moreover, industry, traffic, and household biomass combustion have become major sources of air pollutant emissions, with substantial spatial and temporal variations. In this Review, we focus on the major constituents of air pollutants and their impacts on chronic respiratory diseases. We highlight targets for interventions and recommendations for pollution reduction through industrial upgrading, vehicle and fuel renovation, improvements in public transportation, lowering of personal exposure, mitigation of the direct effects of air pollution through healthy city development, intervention at population-based level (systematic health education, intensive and individualised intervention, pre-emptive measures, and rehabilitation), and improvement in air quality. The implementation of a national environmental protection policy has become urgent.},

abstract = {In the field of computerized tomographic imaging, many novel reconstruction techniques are routinely tested using simplistic numerical phantoms, e.g. the well-known Shepp–Logan phantom. These phantoms cannot sufficiently cover the broad spectrum of applications in CT imaging where, for instance, smooth or piecewise-smooth 3D objects are common. TomoPhantom provides quick access to an external library of modular analytical 2D/3D phantoms with temporal extensions. In TomoPhantom, quite complex phantoms can be built using additive combinations of geometrical objects, such as, Gaussians, parabolas, cones, ellipses, rectangles and volumetric extensions of them. Newly designed phantoms are better suited for benchmarking and testing of different image processing techniques. Specifically, tomographic reconstruction algorithms which employ 2D and 3D scanning geometries, can be rigorously analyzed using the software. TomoPhantom also provides a capability of obtaining analytical tomographic projections which further extends the applicability of software towards more realistic, free from the “inverse crime” testing. All core modules of the package are written in the C-OpenMP language and wrappers for Python and MATLAB are provided to enable easy access. Due to C-based multi-threaded implementation, volumetric phantoms of high spatial resolution can be obtained with computational efficiency.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular mortality (CVM) attributed to CO levels in Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah, as the major cities in south western of Iran, with population of 2000000 people during 2013? The measured CO data in 2013 by 10 monitoring stations were used in this study. CO data, temperature and pressure were collected through Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah Meteorological Organization and Iranian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Then, these data were processed by Excel software through correcting temperature and pressure, encode, averaging and filtering. Finally, all data were processed to make input file of Air Q model. The results showed that the maximum and the minimum concentration of CO were associated with Ahvaz and Bushehr with annual averages of 8.51 and 3.76 mg/m3, respectively. This could be due to higher fuel consumption gasoline in vehicles in Ahvaz in comparison with Kermanshah and Bushehr. Cardiovascular mortality during 2013 which was attributed to CO in Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah were 15, 10 and 3 cases, respectively. The finding of this study showed that maximum and the minimum cases of CVM attributed to carbon monoxide level were estimated 4.3 and 1.4 percent for Ahvaz and Bushehr.},

abstract = {7 Executive summary Air quality in Europe — 2017 report Executive summary Air pollution is a key environmental and social issue and, at the same time, it is a complex problem posing multiple challenges in terms of management and mitigation of harmful pollutants. Air pollutants are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources; they may be either emitted directly (primary pollutants) or formed in the atmosphere (as secondary pollutants). They have a number of impacts on health, ecosystems, the built environment and the climate; they may be transported or formed over long distances; and they may affect large areas. Effective action to reduce the impacts of air pollution requires a good understanding of its causes, how pollutants are transported and transformed in the atmosphere, and how they affect humans, ecosystems, the climate, and subsequently society and the economy. The current report presents an updated overview and analysis of air quality in Europe from 2000 to 2015. It reviews the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established in the two European Ambient Air Quality Directives, and towards the long-term objectives of achieving levels of air pollution that do not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment. It also presents the latest findings and estimates on population and ecosystem exposure to the air pollutants with the greatest impacts and effects on human health and the environment (Box ES.1). The evaluation of the status of air quality is based mainly on ambient air measurements, in conjunction with data on anthropogenic emissions and their evolution over time. Air quality policies have delivered, and continue to deliver, many improvements. Reduced emissions have improved air quality in Europe, and, for a number of pollutants, exceedances of European standards are rare. However, substantial challenges remain and considerable impacts on human health and on the environment persist. A large proportion of European populations and ecosystems are still exposed to air pollution that exceeds European standards and, especially, the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs). Effective air quality policies require action and cooperation at global, European, national and local levels, which must reach across most economic sectors and engage the public. Holistic solutions must be found that involve technological development and structural and behavioural changes. These will be necessary to achieve human wellbeing and social development, to protect the natural capital and to support economic prosperity, all of which are part of the European Union's (EU) 2050 vision of living well within the limits of the planet.},

abstract = {In this study, we theoretically investigate the re-construction of 2-D cross sections through Gaussian concen-tration distributions, e.g. emission plumes, from long path DOAS measurements along a limited number of light paths. This is done systematically with respect to the extension of the up to four peaks and for six different measurement setups with 2–4 telescopes and 36 light paths each. We distinguish between cases with and without additional background con-centrations. Our approach parametrises the unknown distri-bution by local piecewise constant or linear functions on a regular grid and solves the resulting discrete, linear system by a least squares minimum norm principle. We show that the linear parametrisation not only allows better representa-tion of the distributions in terms of discretisation errors, but also better inversion of the system. We calculate area inte-grals of the concentration field (i.e. total emissions rates for non-vanishing perpendicular wind speed components) and show that reconstruction errors and reconstructed area inte-grals within the peaks for narrow distributions crucially de-pend on the resolution of the reconstruction grid. A recently suggested grid translation method for the piecewise con-stant basis functions, combining reconstructions from sev-eral shifted grids, is modified for the linear basis functions and proven to reduce overall reconstruction errors, but not the uncertainty of concentration integrals. We suggest a pro-cedure to subtract additional background concentration fields before inversion. We find large differences in reconstruction quality between the geometries and conclude that, in general, for a constant number of light paths increasing the number of telescopes leads to better reconstruction results. It ap-pears that geometries that give better results for negligible measurement errors and parts of the geometry that are better resolved are also less sensitive to increasing measurement er-rors.},

Although conceptually this approach is much simpler than the transform-based methods discussed in previous sections, for medical applications it lacks the accuracy and the speed of implementation. However, there are situations where it is not possible to measure a large number of projections, or the projections are not uniformly distributed over 180 or 360”) both these conditions being necessary requirements for the transformbased techniques to produce results with the accuracy desired in medical imaging. An example of such a situation is earth resources imaging using cross-borehole measurements discussed in Chapter 4. Problems of this type are sometimes more amenable to solution by algebraic techniques. Algebraic techniques are also useful when the energy propagation paths between the source and receiver positions are subject to ray bending on account of refraction, or when the energy propagation undergoes attenuation along ray paths as in emission CT. [Unfortunately, many imaging problems where refraction is encountered also suffer from diffraction effects (see Chap. 4).] As will be obvious from the discussion to follow, in algebraic methods it is essential to know ray paths that connect the corresponding transmitter and receiver positions. When refraction and diffraction effects are substantial (medium inhomogeneities exceed 10{\%} of the average background value and the correlation length of these inhomogeneities is comparable to a wavelength), it becomes impossible to predict these ray paths. If algebraic techniques are applied under these conditions, we often obtain meaningless results.},

abstract = {In this study we validate the two-dimensional long path DOAS tomography measurement technique by means of an indoor experiment with well-known concentration distributions. The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m × 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO2. The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press),1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km2. Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 {\textgreater} 1.5 ppbv, H2CO {\textgreater} 6.3 ppbv, HONO {\textgreater} 3.2 ppbv, and ozone {\textgreater} 46.2 ppbv.

abstract = {The role of air pollution in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains uncertain. The aim was to assess the impact of chronic exposure to air pollution on COPD in four cohorts using the standardised ESCAPE exposure estimates. Annual average particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO x) and road traffic exposure were assigned to home addresses using land-use regression models. COPD was defined by NHANES reference equation (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) less than the lower limit of normal) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criterion (FEV1/FVC {\textless}0.70) and categorised by severity in non-asthmatics. We included 6550 subjects with assigned NOx and 3692 with PM measures. COPD was not associated with NO2 or PM10 in any individual cohort. In meta-analyses only NO2, NOx, PM10 and the traffic indicators were positively, although not significantly, associated with COPD. The only statistically significant associations were seen in females (COPD prevalence using GOLD: OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.11-2.23; and incidence: OR 1.79, 95{\%} CI 1.21-2.68). None of the principal results were statistically significant, the weak positive associations of exposure with COPD and the significant subgroup findings need to be evaluated in further well standardised cohorts followed up for longer time, and with time-matched exposure assignments.

Some generalizations of previously published ART algorithms are given. In particular, ART is extended to handle weighted projection data. An early conjecture about ART is proved for one of the algorithms: it converges to the most uniform solution of the constraint equations provided by the projection data. Other convergence properties of the ART algorithms are discussed and proved. Some new ART algorithms are described. These are believed to converge to optimal reconstructions consistent with the projection data. The importance of choosing the correct ray widths in case of real projection data is demonstrated, and a method for calculating correct ray widths is given. A method is proposed for estimating the optimal number of iterations in a reconstruction. The performance of ART on real data is demonstrated both in the absence of and in the presence of noise. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e.g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92{\%} of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67{\%} of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56{\%} are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25{\%} of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines.},

abstract = {—A full computer-controlled multiple light paths differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) apparatus are applied for air pollution monitoring in the suburb of NanJing. Two optical paths have been installed in the DOAS system (OPSIS AB, Sweden), which is operating since September 2007, and both are controlled with the same main unit, and so only one analyzer system studies the light received. A beam-finding servosystem and automatic gain control permit unattended long-time monitoring. The concentrations and standard deviations of a wide number of pollutants, along with light levels in the system are stored in the central unit computer. Being able to monitor a range of user-specified compounds continuously in real time with a single system, the OPSIS instruments offer high levels of accuracy, reliability and data capture. The first results obtained with the DOAS system are presented in this work; comparisons between pollutant data obtained along the two optical paths (and relations between different pollutant concentrations) have been carried out.},

abstract = {We analyze and compare two approaches for the tomographic reconstruction of trace gas distributions in the atmosphere, adapted to differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) applications. The first approach performs the inversion by solving a regularized least squares problem. Regularization is required because the retrieval of the distribution from a limited set of measurements is an ill-posed problem. This approach does not consider the nonnegativity of the trace gas concentrations. The second approach is a new proposal that solves an optimization problem with the Laplacian of the solution as the regularization term. This approach enables the possibility of adding the nonnegativity constraint to the solution. The algorithm here is stated as an instance of a convex optimization problem and can numerically be solved using, for example, the CVX package. We test both approaches on reconstructions of simulated gas distributions and different experimental configurations applicable to Multi-Axis DOAS and multispectral imaging measurements. From the results, we can then determine a set of reconstruction parameters appropriate to real plume measurements.},

abstract = {Forest fires represent a constant threat to ecological systems, infrastructure and human lives. The only effective way to minimize damage caused by forest fires is their early detection and fast reaction, apart from preventive measures. Great efforts are therefore made to achieve early forest fire detection, which is traditionally based on human surveillance. There are two types of human surveillance – direct human observation by observers located on monitoring spots and distant human observation based on video surveillance systems. More advanced approach is automatic surveillance and automatic early forest fire detection. Today there are several different approaches but the most feasible is the system based on video cameras sensible in visible spectra. In almost every country which encounters high risk of forest fires at least one such system was developed and proposed. Some of them are on the market under various commercial names. Croatia also has its own system called Integral Forest Fire Monitoring System (in Croatian IPNAS) developed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture University of Split. The system was experimentally tested during 2005 and 2006 fire seasons on three locations in Split and Dalmatia County (Marjan Split Vidova gora Bra{\v{c}} and faculty building Split) but it is also in everyday use in National Park Paklenica from June 2006. This paper describes the main idea behind the Croatian system IPNAS and discusses our experiences during its field tests period in 2005 and 2006.},

abstract = {In this paper we revisit observational data concerning RR Lyrae stars in Galactic globular clusters, presenting frequency histograms of fundamentalized periods for the 32 clusters having more than 12 pulsators with well recognized period and pulsation mode. One finds that the range of fundamentalized periods covered by the variables in a given cluster remains fairly constant in varying the cluster metallicity all over the metallicity range spanned by the cluster sample, with the only two exceptions given by M 15 and NGC 6441. We conclude that the width in temperature of the RR Lyrae instability strip appears largely independent of the cluster metallicity. At the same time, it appears that the fundamentalized periods are not affected by the predicted variation of pulsators luminosity with metal abundance, indicating the occurrence of a correlated variation in the pulsator mass. We discuss mean periods in a selected sample of statistically significant ``RR rich" clusters with no less than 10 RRab and 5 RRc variables. One finds a clear evidence for the well known Oosterhoff dichotomy in the mean period {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} of ab-type variables, together with a similarly clear evidence for a constancy of the mean fundamentalized period {\textless}Pf{\textgreater} in passing from Oosterhoff type II to type I clusters. On this basis, the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is discussed, presenting evidence against a strong dependence of the RR Lyrae luminosity on the metal content. On the contrary, i) the continuity of the mean fundamentalized period, ii) the period frequency histograms in the two prototypes M 3 (type I) and M 15 (type II), iii) the relative abundance of first overtone pulsators, and iv) the observed difference between mean fundamental {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} and fundamentalized periods {\textless}Pf{\textgreater}, all agree in suggesting the dominant occurrence of a variation in the pulsation mode in a middle region of the instability strip (the ``OR" zone), where variables of Oosterhoff type I and type II clusters are pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode, respectively.},

Data from the network will be used primarily for volcanic risk assessment but also for geophysical research, studies of atmospheric change, and ground validation of satellite instruments. A novel type of instrument, the scanning miniaturized differential optical absorption spectroscopy (Mini-{\{}DOAS){\}} instrument, is applied in the network to measure volcanic gas emissions by {\{}UV{\}} absorption spectroscopy. The instrument is set up 5–10 km downwind of the volcano under study, and typically two to four instruments are deployed at each volcano in order to cover different wind directions and to facilitate measurements of plume height and plume direction. Two different versions of the instrument have been developed. Version I was designed to be a robust and simple instrument for measurement of volcanic {\{}SO2{\}} emissions at high time resolution with minimal power consumption. Version {\{}II{\}} was designed to allow the best possible spectroscopy and enhanced flexibility in regard to measurement geometry at the cost of larger complexity, power consumption, and price. In this paper the project is described, as well as the developed software, the hardware of the two instrument versions, measurement strategies, data communication, and archiving routines. As of April 2009 a total of 46 instruments have been installed at 18 volcanoes worldwide.

abstract = {Air pollution represents the biggest environ- mental risk to health. In 2012, one out of every nine deaths was the result of air pollution-rela- ted conditions. Of those deaths, around 3 mil- lion are attributable solely to ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Air pollution affects all regions, settings, socioeconomic groups, and age groups. While all people living in a given area breathe from the same air, there are never- theless important geographical differences in exposure to air pollution. Citizens in Africa, Asia or the Middle East breathe much higher levels of air pollutants that those in living other parts of the world. Some places have air pollution levels that are several times higher than those consi- dered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO) Air quality guidelines. Air pollution is used as a marker of sustai- nable development, as sources of air pollu- tion also produce climate-modifying pollutants (e.g. CO2 or black carbon). Policies to address air pollution also generate a range of bene- fits to human health, not only through air quality improvements but also other health benefits, such as injury prevention or enabling physical activity. Consequently, concerns about air pollution are reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) : Air pollution levels in cities is cited as an indicator for urban sustainable development (SDG 11) ; access to clean energy – particular- ly clean household fuels and technologies – is highlighted as an indicator for sustainable en- ergy (SDG 7) ; and mortality due to air pollution (ambient and household) is used an indicator for the health SDG goal (SDG 3). Reliable estimates of exposure to and impacts from air pollutants are key to better inform policy-makers, as well as development partners. These figures are neces- sary to track progress in air quality improvements and to help evaluate the effectiveness of policies aiming at reducing air pollution, as well as as- sessment of how much they are contributing to protect health. In 2015, to respond to this major global public health threat, the 194 WHO Member States adop- ted the first World Health Assembly resolution to “ address the adverse health effects of air pollu- tion ”. The following year, Member States agreed on a road map for “ an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution ”. Among the main elements of this road map are the monitoring and reporting of air pollution, and enhanced systems, structures and processes for monitoring and reporting health trends asso- ciated with air pollution and its sources. The current report presents methods and data for two of the SDG indicators reported by WHO : {\textperiodcentered} SDG Indicator 11.6.2 : Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) in cities (population-weighted) ; and {\textperiodcentered} SDG Indicator 3.9.1 : Mortality rate attribu- ted to household and ambient air pollution. This report presents the updated results of morta- lity and morbidity attributed to ambient air pollu- tion (also known as ‘ burden of disease due to air pollution '). It includes information on the sources of data on air pollution available to the WHO, on the methodology used to estimate human exposure to air pollution and related burden of disease, as well as the actual estimates of human exposure to particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5 ) for countries and for the globe ; and the related national burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution for the year 2012. The global exposure assessment to air pollu- tion consists of modelled data of population- weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations. Data are modelled through combining remote satellite sensing data with ground measure- ments from the 2016 WHO ambient (outdoor) air quality database, which serves for calibration of the satellite data},

abstract = {Objectives: Our aim was to study the possible associations between exposure to elevated levels of air pollution, ozone (O3) and vehicle exhaust (NOx), during early gestation, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Design: Prospective register-based cohort study. Setting: The Swedish Medical Birth Register includes data on all deliveries during 1998 to 2006 in Greater Stockholm, Sweden. The national Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register were used to collect information on maternal asthma. Participants: All singleton pregnancies, conceived at the earliest in August 1997 and at the latest in February 2006, were included, n=120 755. Outcome measures: We studied preterm birth, small for gestational age and pre-eclampsia. Results: 4.4{\%} of pregnancies resulted in a preterm birth. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 2.7{\%}. We observed an association between first trimester O3 and preterm birth (OR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.08) as well as an association with pre-eclampsia (OR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.08), per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in O3. We observed no association between first trimester NOx and adverse pregnancy outcomes. No associations were observed between any of the air pollutants and small for gestational age. Conclusions: Increased levels of O3 during the first trimester increased the risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Air pollutants did not exhibit any effects on fetal growth restriction. We estimated 1 in every 20 cases of pre-eclampsia to be associated with O3 exposure.},

abstract = {—As we all know, the forest is considered as one of the most important and indispensable resources, the prevention and detection of the forest fire, have been researched hotly in worldwide Forest Fire Prevention Departments. Based on the deficiencies of conventional forest fire detection on real time and monitoring accuracy, the wireless sensor network technique for forest fire detection was introduced, together with satellite monitoring, aerial patrolling and manual watching ,an omni-bearing and stereoscopic air and ground forest-fire detection pattern was found so that the decision for fire-extinguishing or fire prevention can be made rightly and real-timely by related government departments. A cluster-based wireless sensor network paradigm for forest fire real-time detection was put forward in this paper. Some key questions were discussed emphatically, such as the ad hoc network related technology, the node hardware designing, the forest-fire forecasting model and the propagation characteristic of UHF wireless signal and so on. Index Terms—forest fire detection, wireless sensor network, ad hoc network, radio wave attenuations, wireless communication I. THE IMPORTANCE OF WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK TO FOREST FIRE DETECTION A. The Importance of Forest Fire Detection The forest is considered as one of the most important and indispensable resource, furthermore, as the protector of the earth's ecological balance .However, forest fire, affected by some human uncontrolled behavior in social activities and abnormal natural factors, occurs occasionally. Forest fire was considered as one of the severest disasters, which destroyed forest resources safety and threatened human-living environment. Recently, with the affection of factors such as climatic fluctuations, human activities, etc, a tendency of intense increase was showed in the forest fire. Accordingly, a significant hotspots to the prevention and detection of the forest fire, has been researched in worldwide Forest Fire Prevention Departments [1-3]. B. Forest Fire Detection System Based on Wireless Sensor Network At present, traditional forest fire prevention measures were ground patrolling, watching tower, aerial prevention, long-distance video detection and satellite monitoring and so on.},

In particular, these techniques are commonly used to obtain images of a gamma-emitter distribution after its administration in the human body.

A general overview of analytic and iterative methods of reconstruction in SPECT is presented with a special focus on filter backprojection (FBP), conjugate gradient, maximum likelihood expectation maximization, and maximum a posteriori expectation maximization algorithms. The FBP algorithm is faster than iterative algorithms, with the latter providing a framework for accurately modeling the emission and detection processes.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy ͑MAX-DOAS͒ is proposed. The pro-cedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two-or three-dimensional trace gas distri-butions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measure-ments taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

Long and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact on human including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, and long-term chronic diseases such as cancer. Several reports have revealed the direct association between exposure to the poor air quality and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution is considered as the major environmental risk factor in the incidence and progression of some diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, ventricular hypertrophy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychological complications, autism, retinopathy, fetal growth, and low birth weight.

The wide variety of pollutants released by wildland fire include greenhouse gases, photochemically reactive compounds, and fine and coarse particulate matter. Through direct emissions and secondary chemical and physical processes, wildland fire can have a significant impact on tropospheric chemistry and serve as a major source of air pollution. We provide a synthesis of emission factor data from the literature and previously unpublished research for use in global, continental and regional scale studies investigating the role of wildland fire emissions in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The emission factor data is presented by geographic zones (boreal, temperate, and tropical) and vegetation group (forest and savanna/rangeland), allowing researchers to account for the different emission characteristics exhibited by biomass burning in these disparate regions. A brief overview of the wildland fuel combustion process as related to emissions production is also provided. The atmospheric fate of wildland fire emissions is briefly discussed and related to the production of secondary air pollutants. Previously unpublished results from a series of fire emission studies in the United States and Canada are presented in an appendix. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fire as a natural disaster plays a major role in deforestation; is a major source of trace gases, aerosols and carbon fluxes. Approximately 7 percent of Iran area is covered by forests/and wooded lands. According to the ECE/FAO database on forest/other wooded land fires in Iran (1982-1995), the number of fires per year is 130 and the average area burnt per year is 5400 ha, but fires are not largely monitored and enough detection facilities are not available. The use of remote sensing is now a useful alternative, especially in vast and remote areas. The objective of this paper is to inspect the applicability of using MODIS imagery for forest fire detection in Iran, so a comparative study between a graph-based algorithm proposed by Byun et al. (2005) and two contextual algorithms developed by Giglio et al. (2003) and Wang et al. (2007) using MODIS data acquired over Kerman shah province in summer 2006 is present. The results were compared with ground-based observations collected with GPS. It implies that the algorithm developed by Giglio et al. (2003), MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm, performed best with the least commission and omission errors; has potential to be applied in detecting the fire pixels that start in or around forests and are mainly surface fires and seldom crown fires. As a result, using daily MODIS data, it is possible to track fire development in Iran. 1.},

abstract = {Optical remote sensing and iterative computed tomography (CT) can be applied to measure the spatial distribution of gaseous pollutant concentrations. We conducted chamber experiments to test this combination of techniques using an open path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR) and a standard algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Although ART converged to solutions that showed excellent agreement with the measured ray-integral concentrations, the solutions were inconsistent with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. A new CT method was developed that combines (1) the superposition of bivariate Gaussians to represent the concentration distribution and (2) a simulated annealing minimization routine to find the parameters of the Gaussian basis functions that result in the best fit to the ray-integral concentration data. This method, named smooth basis function minimization (SBFM), generated reconstructions that agreed well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the concentration profiles generated from point sampling. We present an analysis of two sets of experimental data that compares the performance of ART and SBFM. We conclude that SBFM is a superior CT reconstruction method for practical indoor and outdoor air monitoring applications.},

abstract = {We examined the associations between the daily variations of air pollutants and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in İstanbul, the largest city of Turkey. A time series analysis of counts of daily hospital admissions and outdoor air pollutants was performed using single-pollutant Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) while controlling for time trends and meteorological factors over a 3-year period (2013–2015) at different time lags (0–9 days). Effects of the pollutants (Excess Risk, ER) on current-day (lag 0) hospital admissions to the first ten days (lag 9) were determined. Data on hospital admissions, daily mean concentrations of air pollutants of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 and daily mean concentrations of temperature and humidity of İstanbul were used in the study. The analysis was conducted among people of all ages, but also focused on different sexes and different age groups including children (0–14 years), adults (35–44 years) and elderly (≥65 years). We found significant associations between air pollution and respiratory related hospital admissions in the city. Our findings showed that the relative magnitude of risks for an association of the pollutants with the total respiratory hospital admissions was in the order of: PM2.5, NO2, and PM10. The highest association of each pollutant with total hospital admission was observed with PM2.5 at lag 4 (ER = 1.50; 95{\%} CI = 1.09–1.99), NO2 at lag 4 (ER = 1.27; 95{\%} CI = 1.02–1.53) and PM10 at lag 0 (ER = 0.61; 95{\%} CI = 0.33–0.89) for an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in concentrations of the pollutants. In conclusion, our study showed that short-term exposure to air pollution was positively associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions in İstanbul during 2013–2015. As the first air pollution hospital admission study using GLM in İstanbul, these findings may have implications for local environmental and social policies.},

abstract = {Air pollution is composed of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone. PM is classified according to size into coarse particles (PM10), fine particles (PM2.5) and ultrafine particles. We aim to provide an original review of the scientific evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies examining the cardiovascular effects of outdoor air pollution. Pooled epidemiological studies reported that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 11{\%} increase in cardiovascular mortality. Increased cardiovascular mortality was also related to long-term and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to air pollution and road traffic was associated with an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, as shown by premature aortic and coronary calcification. Short-term increases in air pollution were associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and acute heart failure. The risk was increased even when pollutant concentrations were below European standards. Reinforcing the evidence from epidemiological studies, numerous experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution promotes a systemic vascular oxidative stress reaction. Radical oxygen species induce endothelial dysfunction, monocyte activation and some proatherogenic changes in lipoproteins, which initiate plaque formation. Furthermore, air pollution favours thrombus formation, because of an increase in coagulation factors and platelet activation. Experimental studies also indicate that some pollutants have more harmful cardiovascular effects, such as combustion-derived PM2.5 and ultrafine particles. Air pollution is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Promotion of safer air quality appears to be a new challenge in cardiovascular disease prevention.},

abstract = {Objectives Air pollution is an important public health concern especially for children who are particularly susceptible. Latin America has a large children population, is highly urbanized and levels of pollution are substantially high, making the potential health impact of air pollution quite large. We evaluated the effect of air pollution on children respiratory mortality in four large urban centers: Mexico City, Santiago, Chile, and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Methods Generalized Additive Models in Poisson regression was used to fit daily time-series of mortality due to respiratory diseases in infants and children, and levels of PM10 and O3. Single lag and constrained polynomial distributed lag models were explored. Analyses were carried out per cause for each age group and each city. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to combine the city-specific results in a single summary estimate. Results These cities host nearly 43 million people and pollution levels were above the WHO guidelines. For PM10 the percentage increase in risk of death due to respiratory diseases in infants in a fixed effect model was 0.47{\%} (0.09–0.85). For respiratory deaths in children 1–5 years old, the increase in risk was 0.58{\%} (0.08–1.08) while a higher effect was observed for lower respiratory infections (LRI) in children 1–14 years old [1.38{\%} (0.91–1.85)]. For O3, the only summarized estimate statistically significant was for LRI in infants. Analysis by season showed effects of O3 in the warm season for respiratory diseases in infants, while negative effects were observed for respiratory and LRI deaths in children. Discussion We provided comparable mortality impact estimates of air pollutants across these cities and age groups. This information is important because many public policies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on health consider children as the population group that deserves the highest protection. Air pollution has important impact on children and infant mortality in Latin-American cities with PM10 and to a lesser degree O3 were associated with respiratory deaths.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO2, HCHO, SO2, H2O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg. {\textcopyright} 2006 Optical Society of America.},

A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

abstract = {In this study we validate the two-dimensional long path DOAS tomography measurement technique by means of an indoor experiment with well-known concentration distributions. The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv. Larger plumes can be measured with higher precision.},

abstract = {Millions of children in polluted cities are showing brain detrimental effects. Urban children exhibit brain structural and volumetric abnormalities, systemic inflammation, olfactory, auditory, vestibular and cognitive deficits v low-pollution controls. Neuroinflammation and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown target the olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and brainstem, but are diffusely present throughout the brain. Urban adolescent Apolipoprotein E4 carriers significantly accelerate Alzheimer pathology. Neurocognitive effects of air pollution are substantial, apparent across all populations, and potentially clinically relevant as early evidence of evolving neurodegenerative changes. The diffuse nature of the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration forces to employ a weight of evidence approach incorporating current clinical, cognitive, neurophysiological, radiological and epidemiological research. Pediatric air pollution research requires extensive multidisciplinary collaborations to accomplish a critical goal: to protect exposed children through multidimensional interventions having both broad impact and reach. Protecting children and teens from neural effects of air pollution should be of pressing importance for public health. {\textcopyright} 2014 Calder{\'{o}}n-Garcidue{\~{n}}as, Torres-Jard{\'{o}}n, Kulesza, Park and D'Angiulli.},

Compared with the traditional techniques of forest fires detection, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology is a very promising green technology for the future in detecting efficiently the forest fires. In this paper we propose a comparative study between two forest fires detection methods (Canadian and Korean) using a real experimental approach. The methodology adopted for this study is provided. The related hardware schemes and implemented algorithms are given in detail for both methods. Through the preliminaries results, we conclude the effectiveness of the Canadian approach in terms of energy consumption and execution speed, and its suitability to the context of our country.},

abstract = {There is widespread use of passive remote sensing techniques to quantify trace gas column densities in volcanic plumes utilizing scattered sunlight as a light source. Examples include passive DOAS, COSPEC, and the SO2 camera. In order to calculate trace gas concentrations or volcanic emission fluxes, knowledge about the optical path through the plume is necessary. In the past, a straight photon path through the plume has always been assumed although it was known that this is not always true. Here we present the results of model studies conducted specifically to quantify the effects of realistic radiative transfer in and around volcanic plumes on ground-based remote sensing measurements of SO2. The results show that measurements conducted without additional information on average photon paths can be inaccurate under certain conditions, with possible errors spanning more than an order of magnitude. Both over and underestimation of the true column density can occur. Actual errors depend on parameters such as distance between instrument and plume, plume SO2 concentration, plume aerosol load, as well as aerosol conditions in the ambient atmosphere. As an example, a measurement conducted with an SO2 camera is discussed, the results of which can only be correctly interpreted if realistic radiative transfer is considered. Finally, a method is presented which for the first time allows the retrieval of actual average photon paths in spectroscopic (i. e. DOAS) measurements of adequate resolution. By allowing for a wavelength dependent column density during the evaluation of DOAS measurements, we show how radiative transfer effects can be corrected using information inherently available in the measured spectra, thus greatly enhancing the accuracy of DOAS measurements of volcanic emissions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The easyPET scanner has an innovative design, comprising only two array columns facing each other, and with an actuation defined by two rotation axes. Using this design, two approaches have been taken. The first concerns to a didactic PET scanner, where the arrays of detectors are comprised of only one detector each, and it is meant to be a simple 2-dimensional PET scanner for educational purposes. The second corresponds to a pre-clinical scanner, with the arrays having multiple detectors, meant to acquire 3-dimensional data. Given the geometry of the system, there is no concern with the effects of not measuring the Depth-of-Interaction (DOI), and a resolution of 1-1.5 mm is expected with the didactic system, improving with the pre-clinical. The work presented in this thesis deals with 2D image reconstruction for the easyPET scanners. The unconventional nature of the acquisition geometry, the large amount of data to be processed, the complexity of implementing a PET image reconstruction algorithm, and the implementation of data regularization methods, gaussian filtering and Median Root Prior (MRP), were addressed in this thesis. For this, the Matlab software was used to implement the ML-EM algorithm. Alongside, several optimizations were also implemented in order to convey a better computational performance to the algorithm. These optimizations refer to using geometry symmetries and fast indexing approaches. Moreover, a user interface was created so as to enhance the user experience for the didactic easyPET system. The validation of the implemented algorithm was performed using Monte Carlo simulated, and acquired data. The first results obtained indicate that the optimizations implemented on the algorithm have successfully reduced the image reconstruction time. On top of that, the system was tested according to the NEMA rules. A comparison was then made between reconstructed images produced by using Filtered Back Projection (FBP), the native ML-EM implementation, the ML-EM algorithm using inter- iteration gaussian filtering, and the ML-EM algorithm implemented with the MRP. This comparison was made through the calculation of FWHM, FWTM, and SNR, at different spatial positions. The results obtained reveal an approximate 1.5x 1.5 mm2 FWHM source resolution in the FOV, when recurring to FBP, and 1.2x 1.2 mm2 for the native ML-EM algorithm. The implemented data regularization methods produced similar or improved spatial resolution results, whilst improving the source's SNR values. The results obtained show the potential in the easyPET systems. Since the didactic scanner is already on its final stage, the next step will be to further test the pre-clinical system},

abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution is a serious and common public health concern associated with growing morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last decades, the adverse effects of air pollution on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems have been well established in a series of major epidemiological and observational studies. In the recent past, air pollution has also been associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been demonstrated that various components of air pollution, such as nanosized particles, can easily translocate to the CNS where they can activate innate immune responses. Furthermore, systemic inflammation arising from the pulmonary or cardiovascular system can affect CNS health. Despite intense studies on the health effects of ambient air pollution, the underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests that air pollution-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and alterations in the blood-brain barrier contribute to CNS pathology. A better understanding of the mediators and mechanisms will enable the development of new strategies to protect individuals at risk and to reduce detrimental effects of air pollution on the nervous system and mental health.

abstract = {Abstract. Fires are an important factor in shaping Earth's ecosystems. Plant and animal life, in almost every land habitat, are at least partially dependent on the effects of fire. However, their destructive force, which has often proven uncontrollable, is one of our greatest concerns, effectively resulting in several policies in the most important industrialised regions of the globe. This paper aims to comprehensively characterise the Forest Fire Finder (FFF), a forest fire detection system based mainly upon a spectroscopic technique called differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS). The system is designed and configured with the goal of detecting higher-than-the-horizon smoke columns by measuring and comparing scattered sunlight spectra. The article covers hardware and software, as well as their interactions and specific algorithms for day mode operation. An analysis of data retrieved from several installations deployed in the course of the last 5 years is also presented. Finally, this paper features a discussion on the most prominent future improvements planned for the system, as well as its ramifications and adaptations, such as a thermal imaging system for short-range fire seeking or environmental quality control.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a mobile biological sensor system that can assist in early detection of forest fires one of the most dreaded natural disasters on the earth. The main idea presented in this paper is to utilize animals with sensors as Mobile Biological Sensors (MBS). The devices used in this system are animals which are native animals living in forests, sensors (thermo and radiation sensors with GPS features) that measure the temperature and transmit the location of the MBS, access points for wireless communication and a central computer system which classifies of animal actions. The system offers two different methods, firstly: access points continuously receive data about animals' location using GPS at certain time intervals and the gathered data is then classified and checked to see if there is a sudden movement (panic) of the animal groups: this method is called animal behavior classification (ABC). The second method can be defined as thermal detection (TD): the access points get the temperature values from the MBS devices and send the data to a central computer to check for instant changes in the temperatures. This system may be used for many purposes other than fire detection, namely animal tracking, poaching prevention and detecting instantaneous animal death.},

abstract = {Air pollution is a heterogeneous mixture of gases, liquids and PM (particulate matter). In the modern urban world, PM is principally derived from fossil fuel combustion with individual constituents varying in size from a few nanometres to 10 $\mu$m in diameter. In addition to the ambient concentration, the pollution source and chemical composition may play roles in determining the biological toxicity and subsequent health effects. Nevertheless, studies from across the world have consistently shown that both short- and long-term exposures to PM are associated with a host of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischaemia and infarctions, heart failure, arrhythmias, strokes and increased cardiovascular mortality. Evidence from cellular/toxicological experiments, controlled animal and human exposures and human panel studies have demonstrated several mechanisms by which particle exposure may both trigger acute events as well as prompt the chronic development of cardiovascular diseases. PM inhaled into the pulmonary tree may instigate remote cardiovascular health effects via three general pathways: instigation of systemic inflammation and/or oxidative stress, alterations in autonomic balance, and potentially by direct actions upon the vasculature of particle constituents capable of reaching the systemic circulation. In turn, these responses have been shown to trigger acute arterial vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, arrhythmias and pro-coagulant/thrombotic actions. Finally, long-term exposure has been shown to enhance the chronic genesis of atherosclerosis. Although the risk to one individual at any single time point is small, given the prodigious number of people continuously exposed, PM air pollution imparts a tremendous burden to the global public health, ranking it as the 13th leading cause of morality (approx. 800000 annual deaths). {\textcopyright} The Authors.},

abstract = {Aromatic hydrocarbons are well known air toxics which are regulated by the US EPA and other air quality agencies. Accurate, long-term monitoring of these compounds at low part-per-billion levels, as well as identifying emission point sources is therefore crucial to protect human health in neighborhoods near large emission sources. Here we present a new long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) instrument specifically designed to monitor aromatic hydrocarbons. The system is based on a novel dual - light emitting diode (LED) light source, which eliminates the requirement to suppress spectrometer stray light. This light source, together with a high stability fiber-based sending/receiving telescope, allows the measurement of aromatic hydrocarbons on once-folded absorptions paths of 200–1200 m length. The new instrument shows very good agreement with simultaneous in-situ measurements if inhomogeneities of the trace gas spatial distributions are considered. The new instrument performed well during a three-month field test as an automated fence-line monitor at a refinery, successfully distinguishing upwind background levels of ∼1 ppb from emissions reflected in elevated mixing ratios of 3–4 ppb. A two-dimensional measurement network based on two identical LP-DOAS instruments operating on seven crossed light paths was operated successfully in Houston, TX. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of two events with toluene and xylene plumes demonstrate how this setup can be used to derive the spatial distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and identify point sources.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) has become a widely used method to measure trace gases in the atmosphere. Their concentration is retrieved by a numerical analysis of the atmospheric absorption spectra, which often are a combination of overlapping absorption structures of several trace gases. A new analysis procedure was developed, modeling atmospheric spectra with the absorption structures of the individual trace gases, to determine their concentrations. The procedure also corrects differences in the wavelength-pixel mapping of these spectra. A new method to estimate the error of the concentrations considers the uncertainty of this correction and the influence of random residual structures in the absorption spectra.},

abstract = {In the US, wildfires and prescribed burning present significant$\backslash$nchallenges to air regulatory agencies attempting to achieve and maintain$\backslash$ncompliance with air quality regulations. Fire emission factors (EF) are$\backslash$nessential input for the emission models used to develop wildland fire$\backslash$nemission inventories. Most previous studies quantifying wildland fire EF$\backslash$nof temperate ecosystems have focused on emissions from prescribed$\backslash$nburning conducted outside of the wildfire season. Little information is$\backslash$navailable on EF for wildfires in temperate forests of the conterminous$\backslash$nUS. The goal of this work is to provide information on emissions from$\backslash$nwildfire-season forest fires in the northern Rocky Mountains, US.$\backslash$nIn August 2011, we deployed airborne chemistry instruments and sampled$\backslash$nemissions over eight days from three wildfires and a prescribed fire$\backslash$nthat occurred in mixed conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains.$\backslash$nWe measured the combustion efficiency, quantified as the modified$\backslash$ncombustion efficiency (MCE), and EF for CO2, CO, and CH4. Our study$\backslash$naverage values for MCE, EFCO2, EFCO, and EFCH4 were 0.883, 1596 g$\backslash$nkg(-1), 135 g kg(-1), 7.30 g kg(-1), respectively. Compared with$\backslash$nprevious field studies of prescribed fires in temperate forests, the$\backslash$nfires sampled in our study had significantly lower MCE and EFCO2 and$\backslash$nsignificantly higher EFCO and EFCH4.$\backslash$nThe fires sampled in this study burned in areas reported to have$\backslash$nmoderate to heavy components of standing dead trees and down dead wood$\backslash$ndue to insect activity and previous fire, but fuel consumption data was$\backslash$nnot available. However, an analysis of MCE and fuel consumption data$\backslash$nfrom 18 prescribed fires reported in the literature indicates that the$\backslash$navailability of coarse fuels and conditions favorable for the combustion$\backslash$nof these fuels favors low MCE fires. This analysis suggests that fuel$\backslash$ncomposition was an important factor contributing to the low MCE of the$\backslash$nfires measured in this study.$\backslash$nThis study only measured EF for CO2, CO, and CH4; however, we used our$\backslash$nstudy average MCE to provide rough estimates of wildfire-season EF for$\backslash$nPM2.5 and four non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) using MCE and EF$\backslash$ndata reported in the literature. This analysis suggests the EFPM2.5 for$\backslash$nwildfires that occur in forests of the northern Rocky Mountains may be$\backslash$nsignificantly larger than those reported for temperate forests in the$\backslash$nliterature and that used in a recent national emission inventory. If the$\backslash$nMCE of the fires sampled in this work are representative of the$\backslash$ncombustion characteristics of wildfire-season fires in similar forest$\backslash$ntypes across the western US then the use of EF based on prescribed fires$\backslash$nmay result in an underestimate of wildfire PM2.5 and NMOC emissions.$\backslash$nGiven the magnitude of biomass consumed by western US wildfires, this$\backslash$nmay have important implications for the forecasting and management of$\backslash$nregional air quality.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper uses combustion efficiency as an independent variable for predicting emission factors for, among others, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and particulate matter. Other gases are correlated with the release of carbon monoxide. The release of nitrogen and sulfur-based compounds occurs in relation to their content in the biomass. The Sundance Fire is used to model the emissions from major fires that have occurred in the United States. Approximately 1 Tg of biomass was consumed by this fire, which released 0.019, 0.151, 1.545, and 0.007 Tg of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen, respectively. Other fires have released over 50 times this amount. Global emissions of various products of combustion are dependent on the combustion efficiency of the fires. ?? 1991.},

We propose some innovative solutions in the field of DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote systems, utilizing diffuse solar light as the radiation source. We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the «off-axis» methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new measurement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

CT reconstructions were performed using the recently developed smooth basis function minimization (SBFM) technique. The CT reconstructions were compared with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. Agreement between the two sampling methods was qualitatively very good, with concentration profiles generated by both methods showing the same features of peak location and shape. Quantitative agreement was generally good to within 50{\%}. We discuss the sources of discrepancy and suggest directions for future research, especially with regard to monitoring time-dependent processes.

Written shortly after the passage of the seminal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the third edition was quite timely. Surprisingly, the text has remained relevant for university professors, engineers, scientists, policy makers and students up to recent years. However, in light of the transition in the last five years from predominantly technology-based standards (maximum achievable control technologies or MACTs) to risk-based regulations and air quality standards, the text must be updated significantly. The fourth edition will be updated to include numerous MACTs which were not foreseen during the writing of the third edition, such as secondary lead (Pb) smelting, petroleum refining, aerospace manufacturing, marine vessel loading, ship building, printing and publishing, elastomer production, offsite waste operations, and polyethylene terephthalate polymer and styrene-based thermoplastic polymers production. Overall, revisions will reflect the numerous changes in the understanding of air pollution and the development of new technologies that has occurred in the past twelve years. * Focuses on the process of risk assessment, management and communication, the key to the study of air pollution. * Provides the latest information on the technological breakthroughs in environmental engineering since last edition * Updated inforamtion on computational and diagnostic and operational tools that have emerged in recent years. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With over 75{\%} of Europeans living and working in urbanised areas the quality of air in this environment is of extreme importance, influencing directly the health and well being of a significant proportion of the continent's population as well as impacting on the greater ecosystem. A microenvironment of particular interest is the street canyon where the spatial and temporal characteristics of pollutants are known to be complex, resulting from airflow patterns that transport and disperse the pollutants. Measurement of pollutants exhibiting such spatial and temporal variability will require new sensing approaches with high data quality standards. We discuss the use of Tomographic-DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) for the visualisation of the spatial distribution of air contaminants in street canyons. We provide reviews of the DOAS remote sensing technique, explaining how DOAS works and why it has significant advantages over traditional point-sampling methods. We discuss the novel combination of DOAS and computed tomography (CT) to produce Tomographic-DOAS, demonstrating how it can be utilised to produce near real-time maps of concentration levels of multiple air contaminants in a street canyon. We demonstrate this with simulated reconstructions using model based pollutant data for a street canyon. Finally, we discuss the future direction and feasibility of this approach, highlighting current limitations and where further research and development are required.},

abstract = {Geo-referenced imaging systems, (which alert the operator to smoke by day, and fire glow by night) are able to perform at higher sensitivity and over longer distances, by using 3 -D information w hich provides the distance between the camera and every ima ge pixel's line-ofsight projection to the object on the ground. A smoke event at any one of these geo -referenced locations is therefore determined when the system is installed – before the fire is detected. Unlike CCTV based surveillance, every pixel is projected to a ground position at a kno wn distance from the camera, ensuring that smoke signatures a few km from the camera are treated very differently from the equivalent smoke signature at 10 tim es the distance. Usually settings that detect far -field smoke signatures are prone to false alarms in the near -field, and settings which work well for detecting near -field smoke are not reliable when detecting smoke in the far -field. Geo-referenced imagi ng systems achieve a measure of range invariance that compensates for distance effects.},

We propose some innovative solutions in the field of DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote systems, utilizing diffuse so- lar light as the radiation source. We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the «off-axis» methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new meas- urement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

abstract = {In this study we validate the two-dimensional long path DOAS tomography measurement technique by means of an indoor experiment with well-known concentration distributions. The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv. Larger plumes can be measured with higher precision.},

abstract = {In this paper, we developed an analytical fan-beam reconstruction algorithm that compensates for uniform attenuation in SPECT. The new fan-beam algorithm is in the form of backprojection first, then filtering, and is mathematically exact. The algorithm is based on three components. The first one is the established generalized central-slice theorem, which relates the 1D Fourier transform of a set of arbitrary data and the 2D Fourier transform of the backprojected image. The second one is the fact that the backprojection of the fan-beam measurements is identical to the backprojection of the parallel measurements of the same object with the same attenuator. The third one is the stable analytical reconstruction algorithm for uniformly attenuated Radon data, developed by Metz and Pan. The fan-beam algorithm is then extended into a cone-beam reconstruction algorithm, where the orbit of the focal point of the cone-beam imaging geometry is a circle. This orbit geometry does not satisfy Tuy's condition and the obtained cone-beam algorithm is an approximation. In the cone-beam algorithm, the cone-beam data are first backprojected into the 3D image volume; then a slice-by-slice filtering is performed. This slice-by-slice filtering procedure is identical to that of the fan-beam algorithm. Both the fan-beam and cone-beam algorithms are efficient, and computer simulations are presented. The new cone-beam algorithm is compared with Bronnikov's cone-beam algorithm, and it is shown to have better performance with noisy projections.},

abstract = {The timing of the human control of fire is a hotly debated issue, with claims for regular fire use by early hominins in Africa at -1.6 million y ago. These claims are not uncontested, but most archae- ologists would agree that the colonization of areas outside Africa, especially of regions such as Europe where temperatures at time dropped below freezing, was indeed tied to the use of fire. Our review of the European evidence suggests that early hominins moved into northern latitudes without the habitual use of fire. It was only much later, from -300,000 to 400,000 y ago onward, that fire became a significant part of the hominin technological reper- toire. It is also from the second half of the Middle Pleistocene onward that we can observe spectacular cases of Neandertal pyro- technological knowledge in the production of hafting materials. The increase in the number of sites with good evidence of fire throughout the Late Pleistocene shows that European Neandertals had fire management not unlike that documented for Upper Paleolithic groups.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO(2), HCHO, SO(2), H(2)O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

Our instrument was 146 m apart from the first building, 196 m from the second and 286 m from the third one. All three buildings are located along a main 10 Avenue.

@article{Gordon1974,
abstract = {Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques (ART) were introduced by Gordon, Bender {\&} Herman (1970) for solving the problem of three dimensional reconstruction from projections in electron microscopy and radiology. This is a deconvolution problem of a particular type: an estimate of a function in a higher dimensional space is deconvolved from its experimentally measured projections to a lower dimensional space. For instance, an x-ray photograph represents the projection of the three-dimensional distribution of x-ray densities within the body onto a two-dimensional plane. A finite number of such photographs taken at different angles allows us to reconstruct an estimate of the original 3-D densities. (Density refers to optical density.) The ART algorithms for solving this problem have a simple intuitive basis. Each projected density is thrown back across the higher dimensional region from whence it came, with repeated corrections to bring each projection of the estimate into agreement with the corresponding measured projection. In order to discuss the ART algorithms, one must first carefully consider the representation of space in digital computers (Sections II and III). Subsequent sections will survey the original ART algorithm (Section IV), convergence criteria (Section V), variations on the ART algorithm (Section VI), reliability of reconstructions (Section VII) and computing efficiency (Section VIII).

As in most algebraic schemes, the region to be reconstructed is divided into small pixels. For each pixel a concentration or attenuation coefficient must be estimated. In the maximum likelihood approach these parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood (probability of the observations). EM algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all EM algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the EM algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates. We discuss the specification of necessary physical features such as source and detector geometries. Actual reconstructions are deferred to a later time.},

abstract = {Background: The Lombardy region in northern Italy ranks among the most air polluted areas of Europe. Previous studies showed air pollution short-term effects on all-cause mortality. We examine here the effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure on deaths and hospitalizations from specific causes, including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases. Methods: We considered air pollution, mortality and hospitalization data for a non-opportunistic sample of 18 highly polluted and most densely populated areas of the region in the years 2003-2006. We obtained area-specific effect estimates for PM10 and NO2 from a Poisson regression model on the daily number of total deaths or cause-specific hospitalizations and then combined them in a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. For cause-specific mortality, we applied a case-crossover analysis. Age- and season-specific analyses were also performed. Effect estimates were expressed as percent variation in mortality or hospitalizations associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 or NO2 concentration. Results: Natural mortality was positively associated with both pollutants (0.30{\%}, 90{\%} Credibility Interval [CrI]: -0.31; 0.78 for PM10; 0.70{\%}, 90{\%}CrI: 0.10; 1.27 for NO2). Cardiovascular deaths showed a higher percent variation in association with NO2 (1.12{\%}, 90{\%} Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14; 2.11), while the percent variation for respiratory mortality was highest in association with PM10 (1.64{\%}, 90{\%}CI: 0.35; 2.93). The effect of both pollutants was more evident in the summer season. Air pollution was also associated to hospitalizations, the highest variations being 0.77{\%} (90{\%}CrI: 0.22; 1.43) for PM10 and respiratory diseases, and 1.70{\%} (90{\%}CrI: 0.39; 2.84) for NO2 and cerebrovascular diseases. The effect of PM10 on respiratory hospital admissions appeared to increase with age. For both pollutants, effects on cerebrovascular hospitalizations were more evident in subjects aged less than 75 years. Conclusions: Our study provided a sound characterization of air pollution exposure and its potential effects on human health in the most polluted, and also most populated and productive, Italian region, further documenting the need for effective public health policies.},

abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An efficient, two-dimensional, analytic, Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) for SPECT has been presented earlier in the literature. The SRT is a reconstruction algorithm based on an analytic formula of the inverse Attenuated Radon Transform which results from the approximation of the sinogram in terms of cubic splines. The algorithm incorporates the attenuation map obtained by a CT scan, to provide attenuation corrected images. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SRT algorithm, using phantoms and real SPECT/CT data, by comparing it with two commonly used reconstruction algorithms: FBP and OSEM. The uniformity and resolution limitations of the analytic SRT algorithm is assessed in simulation studies by using a Uniformity phantom, a slice of the Hoffman brain phantom, and two slices of the NCAT human torso phantom. Appropriate attenuation maps are used for each image. Reconstructed images are obtained for 60, 90, 120, and 180 projections over 360 degrees. Furthermore, real SPECT sinograms and their corresponding CT images are acquired from a clinical SPECT/CT system, and then reconstructed employing the SRT algorithm. The reconstructed images obtained via the SRT algorithm are compared to those produced by FBP and OSEM. Several profiles are presented which illustrate the ability of SRT algorithm to correct for attenuation. The SRT reconstructions from clinical data are also compared with the OSEM reconstructions provided by the commercial system. Comparisons between fused images are also presented. Our preliminary results suggest that SRT appears to provide better reconstructed images than FBP at least for the cases when no attenuation correction is applied to FBP. The reconstruction time for SRT was about 2 sec which is comparable to that of FBP and faster than OSEM. Regarding reconstructions for the data obtained from the clinical system, SRT appears to provide comparable quality images with the OSEM reconstructions processed by the comme- cial system. However, further evaluation of SRT is needed to substantiate this claim. It is also important to note that SRT suffers from striking artifacts, due to angular under-sampling, which become worse at low number of projection angles.},

@article{ValentedeAlmeida2020,
abstract = {TomoSim comes as part of project ATMOS, a miniaturised Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) tomographic atmospheric evaluation device, designed to fit a small drone. During the development of the project, it became necessary to write a simulation tool for system validation. TomoSim is the answer to this problem. The software has two main goals: to mathematically validate the tomographic acquisition method; and to allow some adjustments to the system before reaching final product stages. This measurement strategy was based on a drone performing a sequential trajectory and gathering projections arranged in fan beams, before using some classical tomographic methods to reconstruct a spectral image. The team tested three different reconstruction algorithms, all of which were able to produce an image, validating the team's initial assumptions regarding the trajectory and acquisition strategy. All algorithms were assessed on their computational performance and their ability for reconstructing spectral “images”, using two phantoms, one of which custom made for this purpose. In the end, the team was also able to uncover certain limitations of the TomoSim approach that should be addressed before the final stages of the system.},
