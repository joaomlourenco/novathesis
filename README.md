* NOVA University Lisbon
    * [NOVA School for Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt) (FCT-NOVA)
    * [NOVA Information Management School](https://www.novaims.unl.pt) (NOVA-IMS)

The class provides options to easily set up the cover page, the front matter pages, the page headers, etc. with respect to the official dissertation guidelines for each of the supported Schools.

The template is also easily customizable, including the support for new Schools. Currently the template supports out-of-the-box (at least): 17 Chapter Styles, 7 font sets, 9 schools.  If you customize this template for your institution or add new style files, please [let me knwow](http://docentes.fct.unl.pt/joao-lourenco).  Thanks!
